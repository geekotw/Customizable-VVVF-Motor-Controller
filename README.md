# Customizable-VVVF-Motor-Controller
A project than aims to recreate the sounds of trains with VVVF AC propulsion by running an actual motor.
# Supported Hardware
STM32F446RE Nucleo
Other boards would likely work but have not been tested.
# Circuit Schematic
Currently a work in progress
# Terms of Use
You are free to use any of the code but please don't post modified code without referencing the project page.
# Disclaimer
Although working with just the microcontroller is pretty safe, the circuitry for the inverter contains high voltage which could be dangerous. Use at your own risk.
